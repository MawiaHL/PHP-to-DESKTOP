# PHP-to-DESKTOP
PHP to Desktop is a portable apache server package for php and mysql. Its use IE engine to render its desktop interface. As a developer, you may need to create installer for your php application. This makes it very easy for you. You can use any free/commercial installer for your php application like any other desktop software installer. I do recommend advanced installer (https://www.advancedinstaller.com/) for this purpose. It acts like PHP to .exe converter. The idea is taken from TeamMC. I would really like to credit but I could not find their links any more. May be their domain expired.

Please read HLSERVER MANUAL.pdf to do the installation.
